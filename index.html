                    My name is Jacob McElhaney, this is my wife and I on vacation in Medellín, Colombia. We are 
                    passionate about traveling the world and experiencing everything it has to offer. Immersing oneself 
                    in new environments helps improve ones understanding of our world. I enjoy challenges and creating ways
                    to overcome those challenges. Through diversifying ourselves in life and who we work with we can overcome
                    the challenges we face.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm a Full Stack Developer working remotely in Seattle, Wa. For the last 15 years i've worked in Retail 
                    Management. I wanted a change of scenery and something that I was passionate about. So I started learning 
                    HTML and CSS on my own. I quickly found a thourough enjoyment of developing web applications. The more I 
                    worked at creating web designs and developed applications to blend into those designs I found a deeper 
                    enjoyment in seeing my work come to life.
                
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a web developer, I enjoy using my unique attention to detail, my enjoyment for making things and my 
                    work ethic to create something inspiring. That's why I’m excited to make a big impact at a high growth company.

                I have developed a great understanding of Python, HTML and CSS. I love to use the skills I now have
                to work through challenging problems and designs to see those creations come to life. It has been thrilling
                to create programs and websites that show off my understanding of these languages. I look forward to the next
                adventure that awaits working in this profession.
